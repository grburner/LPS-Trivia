Trivia game:
    select a category -> get questions from an API
    display questions and keep score with a countdown timer
    log high scores and show the 5 highest
    loop back through

Bugs to still resolve:
/* ---- ISSUES ---- */
// fix visible number counter going into negatives in modal***
// make high scores show at right time (wont toggle past 3rd game play***
// some seemingly random jumps in counter
// reformat correct incorrect alert
